# Module1Assignment
This repository is for the first weeks assignment for the bootcamp

This project was to show that I can use semantics in HTML and add notes to show that I understand the code that I am working with. I had to first change the div tags to a descriptive semantic tag and add alt discriptions to the images, I also had to add notes to the css file.
